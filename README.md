# ESP32_MQTT_Multiple_DS18b20
This is a labour of love (and plenty of hate) that took me far too many hours and lots of influence from different coders. The code 
uses MQTT to send multiple DS18B20 temperature sensor readings from an ESP32 to an MQTT broker running on Home Assistant.

Somehow I couldn't find a simple example online that would help me do this, so I've done it myself and hopefully it'll help someone else
